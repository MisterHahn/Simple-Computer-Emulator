### Simple Computer Emulator

A semester-long project completed for my *CS 3A: Computer Organization and Machine Language* class in the Fall of 2012.

##### About this program:
The Simple Computer emulator is a java-based program designed to demonstrate a simplified computer architecture. It has 100 virtual addressable memory locations, a set of 10 op-codes, a virtual Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), and follows a simplified logic and control flow similar to the Intel 80x86 CPU architecture.  The program's I/O is currently done through the console window, while a GUI-based implementation will possibly be a future side project. This virtual machine is based on Thomas Meyer's "Simple Computer Machine" model, and includes the following components in its architecture:
* Memory
* Input Cards (IC)
* Output Cards (OC)
* Instruction Register (IR)
* Accumulator (AC)
* Program Counter (PC)
* Control Unit
